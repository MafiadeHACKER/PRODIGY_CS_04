# PRODIGY_CS_04

# Simple Keylogger

# Overview
This is a basic keylogger program written in Python. The program listens for keyboard events, logs every keystroke (letters, numbers, and special keys), and saves them to a file named keylog.txt. The program will continue logging keystrokes until the Esc key is pressed, at which point the logging will stop.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
pynput library

You can install the necessary library by running:

# How It Works
Log File: The program logs all keystrokes in a file called keylog.txt.

Key Press Events: When a key is pressed, it logs either the character (for letters and numbers) or the key name (for special keys such as Shift, Ctrl, etc.).

Stopping the Program: The keylogger runs continuously until the Esc key is pressed, at which point it will stop logging and exit.

# How to Use

    git clone <repository_url>

Run the Keylogger: Run the program using Python:
    python keylogger.py

Check the Log File: After running the keylogger, open keylog.txt to see the logged keystrokes.

Stop the Keylogger: Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.
